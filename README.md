# week3-Z-transform

This script showcases different aspects of Z-transform and discrete-time signal processing  

### Console output for Q1 - 4

A1: Z-Transform Representation

    Demonstrates symbolic representation of discrete-time signals using Z-transforms  
   
    Shows two examples of creating Z-transform expressions:  
    
    X1: A simple Z-transform with coefficients 1, 2, and 5  
    
    X2: Another Z-transform with explicit zero coefficients

A2: Z-Transform with Specific Conditions

    Explores Z-transform of exponential sequences  
   
    Uses the symbolic variable a with the constraint |a| < 1  
    
    Calculates Z-transforms for different values of a    
    
    Demonstrates how the Region of Convergence (ROC) changes based on a  
    

A3: Linear Combinations and Signal Shifts

    Defines two sequences: x1 and x2  
   
    Computes Z-transforms of: 
   
    Linear combination (2x1 - 3x2)  
    
    Shifted sequence (x1 shifted by 3 units)  
   

A4: Inverse Z-Transform

    Demonstrates inverse Z-transform operations  
   
    Converts Z-domain transfer functions back to time-domain sequences  
   
    Xa: Simple transfer function converted to time-domain  
        
    Xb: More complex transfer function conversion
